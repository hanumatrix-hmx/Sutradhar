# Field Report 2 loop — ledger

Statuses: `TODO -> SPEC -> DEV -> VERIFY -> AUDIT -> FIX(n) -> DONE | BLOCKED | DESCOPED`

| id | title | phase | status | attempts | last evidence | commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR2-01 | wait_for_selector visibility states | 1 | FIX(5) [ESCALATED: Orchestrator-supervised bonus cycle 2/2 -- FINAL allowed cycle] | 9 | audit-5 FAILED fix-4: engine-level tri-state fix confirmed correct, but the SAME pattern survives one layer up in 3 places (MCP hint text, diagnoseSelectorVisibility, countOtherVisibleMatches) that fix-4's inventory never traced to; if this cycle still finds a new instance of the same shape, FR2-01 must be marked BLOCKED with a full diagnosis per the loop's own stated bound | 8b8e3a5 |
