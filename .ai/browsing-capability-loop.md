# Browsing capability loop — persistent state

See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the standing directive this doc supports: find a real
limitation by using Sutradhar → fix it → verify live → log it here → repeat.

## Capability taxonomy

Status per category. `covered` = exercised live and works. `partial` = works in the common
case, known edges untested/unfixed. `untested` = not yet exercised via real dogfooding this
loop. `excluded` = deliberately out of scope (see CLAUDE.md's scope boundary).

| Category | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Basic navigation/click/type/snapshot | covered | Exercised repeatedly this session (example.com, TodoMVC, the dashboard itself). |
| DOM-attribute grounding (`data-sd-node-id`) under re-render | partial | Survived 2 independent real re-render tests (TodoMVC filter round-trip; a continuous-stream sibling-churn test). Id-reuse-after-*deletion* specifically still untested (attempted in Milestone 1, blocked by an unrelated test-script bug, not chased further). |
| Accessibility-tree grounding (`axSnapshot`) | untested | Exists, documented as the recommended default for re-rendering pages, never actually exercised live. |
| Hover / `:hover`-revealed UI | partial | `browser.hover` exists in source and works when called directly against the runtime; confirmed synthetic `mouseover` does NOT trigger real `:hover` (must use the real tool). |
| Multi-tab workflows | covered | Milestone 1: created a background tab via `new_tab`, navigated/snapshotted/clicked it independently via `tabId`, confirmed the original tab was completely unaffected. Works correctly. |
| File download | covered | Milestone 1: `runtime.downloadFile` verified end-to-end — real file landed on disk at the expected path with correct content (read back and checked, not just a success flag). |
| File upload | covered | Milestone 2: `browser.upload_file` against a real fixture page (the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload) — set a file input, clicked Upload, confirmed via the server's own response page ("File Uploaded! upload-test.txt") that it actually landed server-side, not just a client-side success flag. |
| iframes / cross-frame interaction (incl. dynamically-injected, cross-origin) | covered | Milestone 1: verified directly against the runtime — `snapshot`/`click` correctly traverse into a cross-origin iframe injected into the page *after* initial load (the hardest realistic case — matches real chat-widget/payment-iframe behavior). Works correctly today. |
| Shadow DOM | untested | `dom-semantic-engine.ts` has a shadow-piercing pattern reused elsewhere; never dogfooded. |
| PDF handling: export | covered | `browser.export_pdf` verified — returns real, valid `%PDF-1.4` content for the current page. |
| PDF handling: reading one encountered mid-browse | gap found, logged (`PROB-009`) | Navigating directly to a `.pdf` URL correctly enumerates Chrome's native PDF-viewer toolbar via `snapshot`, but `pageText` comes back completely empty even against a PDF with real (compressed) text content. Not fixed — needs real PDF text-layer extraction, nontrivial scope. |
| Real-time/streaming pages (continuous background DOM churn) | partial | Milestone 1: grounding survives ongoing unrelated DOM churn elsewhere on the page (a simulated live-feed stream, numeric id captured then acted on ~8 re-renders later — still hit the right element). True WebSocket/SSE-driven pages and the harder "target itself gets destroyed and id gets reused" case remain untested. |
| Media (video/audio/canvas) | untested | |
| Mobile/device emulation | covered, 1 bug fixed | Milestone 2: `set_viewport`'s width/height/deviceScaleFactor/media-query emulation all verified correct against a real site (github.com). Found and fixed a real gap: `isMobile:true` didn't enable touch (`ontouchstart`) since `hasTouch` was never passed to Puppeteer — real mobile devices always have touch. Fixed by defaulting `hasTouch` to `isMobile`'s value, overridable; verified all 3 cases (default-on, desktop-off, explicit-off) directly against the runtime. |
| Auth/session persistence across runs | covered | Milestone 2: created a named profile via the CLI, logged into a real test fixture (the-internet.herokuapp.com/login), fully closed the session (killed the Chrome process), launched a completely fresh session with the same profile, navigated straight to the auth-gated page — still authenticated, no re-login needed. Works correctly. |
| Network conditions (slow/offline/throttled) | untested | No obvious tool for this yet — check if Puppeteer's CDP network-emulation is exposed. |
| Large-scale extraction / pagination | untested | |
| JS framework diversity beyond React | partial | Only tested against a React app (TodoMVC, the dashboard itself). Vue/Angular/Svelte/vanilla untested. |
| CAPTCHA / bot-detection / stealth evasion | excluded | Deliberately out of scope per CLAUDE.md — not a gap to close. |

## MCP session staleness — resolved 2026-08-13, but re-staleness after every rebuild is a standing gotcha

Milestone 1 hit a stale MCP session that produced a false bug report (iframes looked broken,
weren't). The user reconnected it before Milestone 2, confirmed by `hasTouch`/`data-sd-*` etc.
all resolving correctly. **This isn't a one-time fix** — every future rebuild of `mcp-server`
(or any package it depends on) makes the *currently connected* session stale again until
reconnected. Two fixes landed in Milestone 2 (the double-header bug, the `hasTouch` default)
that the connected session at the time did NOT yet reflect. Standing practice: after any
capability-runtime/mcp-server code change, verify via direct-runtime scripting (import
`SutradharRuntime` from `packages/capability-runtime/dist/index.js`) rather than assuming the
connected MCP session picked it up — and note in the checkpoint report which fixes still need
a reconnect to be live-confirmed end-to-end through MCP itself.

## Iteration log

Append-only. Newest first.

### 2026-08-13 — Milestone 2: upload, auth persistence, mobile emulation, PDF

MCP session was reconnected at the start of this milestone (resolved Milestone 1's blocker).
Sanity-checked first (`data-sd-node-id`/`data-sd-gen` live, correct) before proceeding.

- **File upload**: `browser.upload_file` against a real fixture (the-internet.herokuapp.com/
  upload) — verified server-side, not just client success. No gap found.
- **Bonus fix (not part of the plan, found while sanity-checking)**: `browser.snapshot`'s MCP
  response double-printed its own header with two different element counts (4 vs 1, same
  page) — confusing and live. Root cause: `tools.ts` wrapped `snap.interactiveElements` in its
  own redundant header, not realizing the string already embeds one (the CLI's `cmdSnap` has
  an explicit comment warning about exactly this trap). Fixed, rebuilt, typechecked clean.
  Logged as `PROB-008`, resolved.
- **Auth/session persistence**: created a named CLI profile, logged into a real test fixture,
  fully killed the session, launched fresh with the same profile — still authenticated. No
  gap found; this is a genuinely strong capability already.
- **Mobile/device emulation**: `set_viewport` verified against a real site (github.com) —
  dimensions, pixel ratio, and media queries all correct. Found and fixed a real gap:
  `isMobile:true` never enabled touch event support (`hasTouch` wasn't threaded through to
  Puppeteer at all). Fixed with a sensible default (`hasTouch` follows `isMobile` unless
  overridden), verified all 3 cases directly against the runtime, rebuilt, typechecked clean.
- **PDF handling**: `export_pdf` (page → PDF) verified correct. Reading a PDF encountered via
  direct navigation is a real, confirmed gap — the native viewer's toolbar gets enumerated but
  `pageText` is empty even against a PDF with real text content. Logged as `PROB-009`, open —
  correctly not attempted as a quick fix (needs real PDF text-layer extraction).

**Net result**: 2 real product code fixes landed (double-header bug, `hasTouch` default),
both typechecked and verified directly against the runtime; neither yet confirmed end-to-end
through a live MCP round-trip since the connected session predates both changes — needs
another reconnect to close that loop. 1 new real gap found and deliberately not fixed
(`PROB-009`, PDF text extraction — correctly out of "quick fix" scope). 3 of 4 categories
tested turned out to already work correctly with no changes needed.

### 2026-08-13 — Milestone 1: multi-tab, download, iframes, real-time pages

Tested 4 categories not yet touched this session, all via real dogfooding (live browser,
real or realistically-constructed targets, not mocks):

- **Multi-tab**: Hacker News front page + a story's comments page in a background tab.
  `new_tab`/`tabId`-scoped `snapshot`/`click`/`eval` all worked correctly; confirmed the two
  tabs' state stayed fully isolated. No gap found.
- **File download**: injected a real `<a download>` link, called `runtime.downloadFile`
  directly. File landed on disk with the right name and content (verified by reading it back).
  No gap found; also re-confirms the Wave-8 download-path-containment fix still holds.
- **iframes**: found what looked like a real bug via the connected MCP tools (cross-origin,
  dynamically-injected iframe content invisible to both `snapshot` and `click`) — but this
  turned out to be a **false positive caused by the stale MCP session**, not a real defect.
  Verified directly against `SutradharRuntime` (bypassing MCP): both `snapshot` and `click`
  correctly reach into a cross-origin iframe injected after page load. No real gap; the actual
  finding here is the MCP-staleness blocker logged above.
- **Real-time pages**: simulated a live-updating feed (unrelated DOM churning every 150ms)
  next to a target button; captured the button's numeric grounding id, waited through ~8 more
  re-renders, then clicked via that id — correctly hit the real button every time. Grounding
  holds up under this kind of background churn. The harder case (the *target itself* gets
  destroyed/recreated, e.g. via deletion) remains untested — attempted but blocked by an
  unrelated bug in my own test script, not chased further this round.

**Net result**: no code fixes were needed this milestone — every category tested turned out to
already work correctly. The most valuable finding was procedural, not a product bug: the
stale MCP session is unreliable for verification and produced a false bug report. Logged as a
standing blocker above.

### 2026-08-13 — Loop established (Milestone 0)

Set up `CLAUDE.md` and this doc per the user's request to make the find→fix→verify loop the
standing way of working, not a one-off. No capability work done yet in this entry — Milestone
1 (multi-tab, file download, iframe, real-time page) starts next, logged separately below as
it completes.

## Current milestone

**Milestone 1: DONE** (2026-08-13). **Milestone 2: DONE** (2026-08-13) — see iteration log
above.

**Proposed Milestone 3** (not started, pending user checkpoint per CLAUDE.md): re-verify the
Milestone 2 fixes through an actual MCP round-trip (needs a reconnect), then move to the next
untested batch — shadow DOM, media (video/audio/canvas), network-condition emulation, and
JS-framework diversity beyond React (Vue/Angular/Svelte).
